35-36 Stranger

The Warriors meet a stranger who asks where they are 
heading. After being told, he says that he too is going that 
way, knows a shortcut, and will pay each Warrior 40 gold to 
let him join them. After all, he explains, there is a safety in 
numbers. 

The Warriors must let him join them. Roll 1D6 on the 
following table: 

1-3 The stranger does not know the way and the party is 
	soon lost – add 1D6 weeks to the length of the 
	journey. He is apologetic, however, and when the 
	Warriors finally arrive, he pays each of them 40 gold 
	as promised. 

4-5 The stranger’s short cut turns out to be no quicker. 
	Upon reaching civilization, he pays the Warriors 40 
	gold each. 

6 The stranger does know the way well, knocking a 
	week off the Warriors’ journey time. Upon arrival at 
	their destination, he gratefully pays each Warrior the 
	40 gold as promised.
