61-62 Milita

The Warriors see smoke curling above the trees, and within a 
few minutes reach the crest of a hill overlooking a small 
Settlement. As they get closer, a group of armed men on 
horseback approach. They are the town militia and are very 
wary of strangers. They refuse to let the Warriors stay at the 
Settlement, but for a payment of 30 gold each will allow them 
to pass through it. If the Warriors refuse to pay, they must go 
around the village and the surrounding fields, adding one week 
to their journey.
