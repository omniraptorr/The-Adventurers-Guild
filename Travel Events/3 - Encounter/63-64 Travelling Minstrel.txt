63-64 Travelling Minstrel

A travelling minstrel joins the Warriors for the rest of their 
journey. When they reach the gates of the Settlement they are 
travelling to, he begins to play and sing, convinced that he will 
earn them all free entry to the Settlement. Roll 1D6 on the 
following table when the Warriors reach their destination:
 
1 The minstrels’ playing is awful, and the Warriors are 
	forbidden to enter the Settlement. They must go 
	straight into the next Adventure. 

2-5 No one is particularly impressed, but a few inhabitants 
	give the minstrel some gold. The Warriors meanwhile, 
	are free to enter the Settlement as usual. 

6 The minstrel’s song is so rousing that the inhabitants 
	of the Settlement shower gold upon you. Each Warrior 
	gains 1D6x10 gold.
