15-16 Pedlar

The Warriors are stopped by a pedlar – a strange-looking 
individual wearing brightly coloured rags and carrying a 
number of wicker baskets in which he keeps his wares. He 
capers from side to side, playing a piping tune on a reedy flute. 
The Warriors may buy things from him: 

Healing Potion. 50 gold. Heals 1D6 Wounds. One use.
 
• Lucky Charm. 50 gold. A Warrior wearing this may re-roll 
	any single dice roll once per Adventure. 

• Bronze Wristbands. 30 gold. A Warrior wearing these 
	may ignore 1 Wound during any single combat. One use, 
	then they are broken.
 
• Chalk. 20 gold. A Warrior with chalk may mark an escape 
	route out of the Dungeon and therefore needs not roll on 
	the Escape Table (from the Adventure Book) should they 
	wish to leave the Dungeon. One use. 

• Trinkets. 20 gold. If on the Warriors’ travels anyone 
	demands gold from them for any reason they can try and 
	give them these trinkets instead. Roll 1D6. On a score of 
	1, 2 or 3 they refuse the trinkets and insist on being given 
	the gold. On a score of 4, 5 or 6 they accept the trinkets 
	instead of the gold. Trinkets are only acceptable to fellow 
	travellers, and are never accepted as payment for 
	anything in a Settlement.
 
Each Warrior may buy a maximum of one of each item, except 
trinkets, which they may buy up to six of.
 
	Once the Warriors have made their purchases, the pedlar 
vanishes into the woods. Now roll 1D6 for each object the 
Warriors have bought. If the result is a 1, that item is shoddily 
made and is useless. The Warrior has been conned and must 
discard the item immediately.
