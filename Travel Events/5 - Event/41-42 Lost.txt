41-42 Lost

After a few days’ travel, the Warriors admit to themselves that 
they are absolutely lost. They are about to give up the journey 
completely when they notice smoke curling into the sky a few 
miles away. A couple of hours later, the Warriors discover the 
source of the smoke – a small village not marked on their map.  
Here they are told that the nearest town is another six weeks’ 
travel. The Warriors can either carry on to the town, or end 
their journey now and see what they can buy here.
