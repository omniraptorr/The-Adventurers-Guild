25-26 Guests

The Warriors arrive in a small hamlet as a local festival is in full 
swing, and they are invited to stay as guests.  They are wined 
and fed to excess, and have a most enjoyable evening.
 
	Waking up the next morning, they feel it is only fair to offer 
payment for the hospitality that the villagers have offered. 
Roll 1D6 for each Warrior.  The Warrior with the lowest score 
has to pay the villagers (1D6x20) gold. If two or more 
Warriors score equally low, they must roll off until only one 
player is left to foot the bill.
