53-54 Double Back

After many days’ travel through thick undergrowth, barely 
able to see the sun, the Warriors emerge into a gloomy 
clearing.  In front of them is a cave entrance into a craggy rock 
face. After a moment’s study, they recognise it as the very 
exit by which they left the Dungeon!
 
The Warriors have managed to work their way back to 
where they started and must now set off afresh!
