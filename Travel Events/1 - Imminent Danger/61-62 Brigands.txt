61-62 Brigands

As the Warriors reach the outskirts of a small Settlement, they 
are set upon by brigands demanding gold. They outnumber 
the Warriors, but seem wary of their superior arms and 
armour. The Warriors have a choice:  they can either pay the 
brigands or fight them.
 
If the Warriors decide to pay the brigands, each Warrior 
must give up 1D6x20 gold. 
 
If the Warriors fight the brigands, roll 1D6 for each Warrior 
and add them together. This is the total number of brigands 
that the Warriors are fighting. Then roll another 1D6 for each 
Warrior and add them together. This is the total number of 
brigands that the Warriors manage to kill. If there are any 
brigands left alive after this, then they overpower the 
Warriors, steal 1D6x50 gold from each of them, and disappear 
into the shadows.
