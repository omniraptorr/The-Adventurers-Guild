53-54 Rockfall

As the Warriors trek through a dark ravine, there is a dull 
rumbling above them. A few seconds later a shower of rocks 
and boulders comes crashing down, blocking their route 
completely. Although they can still complete their journey 
without losing any time, they must employ local labourers to 
clear a path, costing each Warrior 1D6x20 gold.
