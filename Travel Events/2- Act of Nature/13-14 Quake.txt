13-14 Quake

The ground opens up in front of the Warriors, creating an 
impassable chasm many miles long. The Warriors have three 
choices: 

a) Abandon any hope they have of reaching a Settlement, 
	in which case they must go straight into the next 
	Adventure.
 
b) Go back to the caves they just left and start their 
	journey again from scratch taking a different route.
 
c) Use any length of rope that they have to cross the 
	chasm. If they cross the chasm with a rope, they may 
	not take horses, carts, etc. with them, and must 
	discard the rope once they have safely reached the 
	other side.
