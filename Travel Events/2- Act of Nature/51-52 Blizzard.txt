51-52 Blizzard

A blizzard howls across the land, swathing all in white. 
Unprepared, the Warriors are trapped in a bitterly cold 
landscape where visibility is reduced to a few yards and 
movement is almost impossible through the banked drifts of 
snow. The Warriors abandon all hope of reaching a town or 
city, and take refuge in the nearest village, cutting their 
journey short. They may buy equipment there as normal. 
After the blizzard abates, the Warriors may go straight into the 
next Dungeon.
